        <h2 class=company>Top Hat</h2>
        <h1>Mobile Pages</h1>
            <p>A Top Hat Page is a content type used for textbook readings and assignments. They can hold text, images, videos, interactive questions, and more. Like an interactive PDF!</p> 
            <p>The mobile experience was not up to par with the web, making for an inadequate reading experience. Students want to read their textbooks on their phones, wherever they are.</p>

        <h3>Steps to building out a vision for mobile pages</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Comparison to web. What features are needed to reach parity with web?</li>
            <li>Competitive analyses. What features exist in other mobile reading apps? How could we delight mobile users with features that don’t exist in web?</li>
            <li>User Interviews. Hearing from students about how they use their textbooks and what they need.</li>
            <li>Data. What features are used most frequently on web? How are they used?</li>
            <li>In-app feedback. Surveying users about their experience to measure improvement over time and hear how we can improve.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Getting in-app feedback</h3>
        <p>I designed an in-app survey, which would occasionally pop-up while a student was reading. This served 2 purposes: to quantitately measure improvement over time, and to get qualitiative input from users.</p>

        <h3>What’s needed to meet parity with web?</h3>
        <p>The web app already had a pretty robust reading experience, and we wanted to at least achieve parity. To do that we needed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy-to-read formatting + styling (ie. text styles, readable tables, bullet points, etc)</li>
            <li>Inline questions</li>
            <li>A table of contents which can be used to quickly navigate</li>
            <li>Highlighting</li>
            <li>Note-taking</li>
            <li>Search (not currently built in web, but ctrl-F does the job)</li>
            <li>Progress indicator for questions answered</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What new features could be useful for mobile?</h3>
        <p>Some features that would be useful for mobile specifically are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download to read offline</li>
            <li>Font-size adjuster</li>
            <li>Night mode</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Improving Readability</h3>
        <p>The first step was to update the text styles and spacing to be easy and enjoyable to read. Previously the text was pretty raw, and tables were not formatted adequately. I came up with various font styles and spacing to make it suitable for mobile.</p>

        <h3>Inline Questions</h3>
        <p>One of the selling features of Top Hat's textbooks is that they include interactive questions. In the app, however, the questions were not inline and had to be opened in a modal. This made it more difficult to refer to the text when answering a question. We wanted to make them inline like on web to make for a smoother experience.</p>

        <h3>Bottom Navigation</h3>
        <p>To access the remaining features, I added a bottom navigation. This wouldn't be there while the student is reading, and would appear at the start and when the user scrolls up.</p>
        <img src="img/pagesnav.png">

        <h3>Index</h3>
        <p>Students can view the table of contents and navigate to a different section via the half page index. This index can be expanded upward to be full screen. I tested out a version that was always full screen, but the half screen was preferred so the user can see the context of the text at the same time as the index.</p>
        <img src="img/index.png">

        <h3>Highlighting + Notes</h3>
        <p>On web, students can highlight the text and take notes. It's important that these show up on mobile as well.</p>
        <img src="img/highlighting.png">

        <h3>Search</h3>
        <p>Students want to be able to search the text, so I designed a search bar that shows the number of results with arrow to move through the results.</p>
        <img src="img/pagessearch.png">

        <h3>Offline Mode</h3>
        <p>Lastly, students wanted to be able to read textbooks when they don't have access to wifi, such as their commute to school.</p>
